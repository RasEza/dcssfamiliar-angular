                This tool was first created so that I could compare the damage of different weapons.
                It is still incomplete, since at some point I would like to have the calculations of the chance to-hit.

            <h3 style="color:#00b8e6" >How to load a character file</h3>
            <p>Watch a video tutorial: <a href="https://youtu.be/co9kUZUk6XQ" target="_blank">youtube link</a></p>
            <p>Quick guide: While playing DCSS, you can press "#" to generate the dump. It will give you an url/path to the character dump file. Go to that text file and select all with "Ctrl-a" and then copy with "Ctrl-c". 
                Then go to DCSS familiar (this website), paste the contents on the above input box, and submit. (note that on mac you use the command key instead of Ctrl)

            <p>Assuming you have no idea about DCSS you can go to <a href="http://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/">http://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/</a>. DCSS is a dungeon crawl roguelike. It is played by downloading a client or in the browser (or by using a terminal)</p>
