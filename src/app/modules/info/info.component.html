            <h3>How to load a character file</h3>
            <p>Watch a video tutorial: <a href="https://youtu.be/co9kUZUk6XQ" target="_blank">youtube link</a></p>
            <p>Quick guide: While playing DCSS, you can press "#" to generate the dump. It will give you an url/path to the character dump file. Got to that text file and select all with "Ctrl-a" and then copy with "Ctrl-c". 
                Then go to DCSS familiar (this website), paste the contents on the above input box, and submit. (note that on mac you use the command key instead of Ctrl)

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>This tool was first created to give a better idea of a weapon damage.
                At some point I will calculate the "to-hit" chance, since I'm intrigued by it. 
                There will also be a spell tab latter, and probably a monster search. 
                Possibly there will be "add weapon" to the weapon list, so that you can theorycraft.
                You can send bugs or requests to &lt;dcssfamiliar@gmail.com&gt;
